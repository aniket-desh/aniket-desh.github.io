    <h1>Scaling the Concrete Jungle</h1>

    <p><span class="gray-date">08.21.2025</span><br><br>
        Cities are amongst the most complex of man-made systems. They grow, sprawl, condense, segregate, and reorganize, not unlike the ways matter undergoes phase transitions. In Marc Barthelemy's <i>The Statistical Physics of Cities</i>, the urban landscape is treated as a statistical ensemble: millions of individual choices leading to emergent collective order. This post is my attempt to outline some neat mathematical objects, with an eye towards open problems in urban planning theory that statistical physics can help illuminate. <br><br> One of the most famous empirical regularities in urban systems is Zipf's law (which appears in almost all complex systems). If cities are ordered by population, the population of the city at rank \(r\) scales as
        \[
        P(r) \sim r^{-\nu},\quad \nu \approx 1
        \]
        In other words, the second-largest city is about half the size of the largest, the third-largest is about a third, and so on. The stability of this power law across time, geography, and cultures is astonishing, and suggests deep underlying principles governing urban growth and organization. The naive Gibrat model for city growth posits multiplicative stochastic dynamics
        \[
            P_i(t+1)  = \eta_i(t)P_i(t)
        \]
        with random growth rates \(\eta_i(t)\). This leads to a log-normal distribution, inconsistent with most urban data. Barthelemy instead highlights diffusion models, extended with migration terms
        \[
        \frac{dP_i}{dt} = \left( \eta_i(t) - 1 \right)P_i(t) + \sum_{j} \left(J_{ji}P_j - J_{ij}P_i\right)
        \]
